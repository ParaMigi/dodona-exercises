# <b>Assignment</b>
Write a program that asks the user for a number, and then says whether that number is a prime number or not.

<details markdown="1"><summary>What are prime numbers?</summary>
A prime number is a positive integer that is divisible only by `1` and itself. The lowest (and only <i>even</i>) prime number is `2`. The first 10 prime numbers are:
`2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, `13`, `17`, `19`, `23`, `29`

<i>(PS: the official definition is a bit more specific, making `1` not a prime number)</i>

# <b>Examples</b>
<details markdown="1"><summary>Example 1</summary>
### Input
```console?lang=python
5
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
5 is prime
```
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Example 2</summary>
### Input
```console?lang=python
21
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
21 is not prime
```
<i>(because 21 is also divisible by 3 and 7)</i>
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Example 3</summary>
### Input
```console?lang=python
17
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
17 is prime
```
</details>

<details markdown="1"><summary>Example 4</summary>
### Input
```console?lang=python
55
```

### Output
```console?lang=python
55 is not prime
```
<i>(because 55 is also divisible by 5 and 11)</i>
